Composition of a DIDS by Integrating Heterogeneous IDSs on Grids
This paper considers the composition of a DIDS (Distributed Intrusion Detection System) by integrating heterogeneous IDSs (Intrusion Detection Systems).
A Grid middleware is used for this integration.
In addition, an architecture for this integration is proposed and validated through simulation.
