A Cross-Layer Approach to Resource Discovery and Distribution in Mobile ad-hoc Networks
This paper describes a cross-layer approach to designing robust P2P system over mobile ad-hoc networks.
The design is based on simple functional primitives that allow routing at both P2P and network layers to be integrated to reduce overhead.
With these primitives, the paper addresses various load balancing techniques.
Preliminary simulation results are also presented.
